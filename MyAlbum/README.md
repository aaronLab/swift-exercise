# My Album

Studying How to Make an iOS app.

## To Do:
- Title Text
- Image
- Price Text
- Refresh Btn 


## How to Make an alert:
- @IBAction function => UIAlertController  => UIAlertAction => addAction => present

## We Will See
- Object, Data, Method
- Strings and Variable
- Connecting Outlet
- Writing Method
- Local vs Instance Variable
- Closure

## String Interpolation
- ```\(variableName)```

## Random Number
- arc4random_uniform(maxNumber)

## Type
- as same as others are
- Integer
- String

## Outlet Update
- viewDidLoad => labelName.text = "\(variableName)"

## Variable / Constant
- var => variable, mutable
- let => constant, immutable, **more recommended**

## Method (function)
```swift
func functionName () {
    print("Hello World")
}
```

## Type Inference
```swift
// Swift will know what type it is.
let pi = 3.14159
// pi is inferred to be of type Double
```

## Local & Instance Variable
- as same as other languages are

## Closure
- Closure = { }
- Which is like a kinda blocks
```swift
// for action handler
handler: {action in
self.refresh()
}
```

## We Will See:
- Swift Playground
- Comment
- Tuple
- Booleans
- Scope
